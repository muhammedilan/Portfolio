        Hello, I'm Muhammed Ilan, I'm 15 years old, I'm going to high school now
        and I'm thinking of going to university in the future. I have been
        interested in web technologies for a long time. I am experienced in
        Frontend and Backend. I developed projects. At first in my software
        life, I was developing projects as a full stack developer, but then I
        decided to become a frontend developer and started paying attention to
        the frontend part. Now I am looking for a job, I would love for you to
        hire me.
